## 📌 Project Overview

## Neo Zen – New Features To Keep Your Browser Clean & Functional 🚀  

Neo Zen introduces powerful new features designed to **maximize space and improve usability**.  
This update brings **three major enhancements**, plus additional refinements.

### 🔹 Better Essentials  
In **collapsed mode**, a new **scrollable hidden area** keeps your tabs uncluttered.  
- **Default:** Expands on hover.  
- **Options:** Choose between **always expanded** or **always collapsed** for greater control.

### 🔹 Better Bottom / Workspace Button  
Organize your **extensions and buttons** all in one place with a **scrollable behavior**.  
- **Default:** Hidden until hovered for 4 seconds.  
- **Options:** Choose between **expanded** or **hidden mode**.

### 🔹 Better Media Control  
Enjoy **media management** even in collapsed mode.  
- **Default:** Media controls remain disabled.  
- **Options:** Enable **expand on hover** for quick access.

### ⚙️ Customization Made Easy  
Modify Neo Zen’s behavior via **"about:config"**.  
For detailed settings and adjustments, check out the [Settings Wiki](https://github.com/JustVibingWhileCoding/Neo-Zen/wiki/Settings).
